# Intersecting Chords Counter

## Overview

This JavaScript function, `countIntersectingChords`, takes two parameters: an array of radians representing chord angles and an array of identifiers indicating the start ("s") and end ("e") points of chords. The function calculates and returns the total number of intersecting chords.




## Function Details

Input Parameters:

- radians (Array): An array of radians representing chord angles.
- identifiers (Array): An array of identifiers indicating the start ("s") and end ("e") points of chords.

Output:

Returns a string indicating the total number of intersecting chords.
## Algorithm:

The function sorts the identifiers and extracts corresponding radians.
It counts intersecting chords by comparing the angles.
The result is formatted as a string for easy interpretation.
Time Complexity Analysis:

The time complexity of the algorithm is O(n^2), where 'n' is the length of the input list radians.


## How to Run
- Copy the countIntersectingChords function into your JavaScript environment or script.
- Call the function with appropriate parameters (array of radians and array of identifiers).
- Log or use the returned result as needed.

Note:
- Ensure the input arrays are appropriately formatted with matching start and end identifiers.
